## 🌐 Overview

This project is a comprehensive portfolio website designed to showcase the skills, projects, and contact information of a web developer named Geoffrey Ominde. The site is built from the ground up with a focus on a clean user interface, responsive design, and smooth user experience. It functions as a single-page application (SPA) for seamless navigation without page reloads, and it is structured to be easily maintainable and deployable on modern hosting platforms.

## 💡 Features

- **Multi-Page Layout in a Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture:** Uses JavaScript to dynamically show and hide page sections, providing fast navigation.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Interactive Components:**
    - **Toggle Mobile Menu:** A hamburger menu for easy navigation on small screens.
    - **Hero Image Slider:** An automated, looping slider on the home page.
    - **Interactive Project Cards:** Hover effects on project showcases.
    - **Lightbox Image Gallery:** A fully functional, keyboard-navigable lightbox for viewing gallery images.
    - **Contact Form with Validation:** Client-side validation to ensure users submit complete and correctly formatted information.
- **Clean & Organized Code:** The codebase is organized into separate folders for styles, scripts, and assets, with clear comments for maintainability.

## 📁 Pages

The website includes the following pages:
1.  **Home:** A welcoming landing page with a hero image slider and an introduction.
2.  **About:** A section describing the developer's background and passion.
3.  **Projects:** A grid-based showcase of past work with links to live demos and source code.
4.  **Gallery:** An image gallery with a lightbox for viewing high-resolution images.
5.  **Contact:** A contact form with validation for user inquiries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For semantic markup and structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), animations, and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, including SPA routing, DOM manipulation, form validation, and the image gallery.
- **No frameworks or libraries:** Built entirely with core web technologies.
